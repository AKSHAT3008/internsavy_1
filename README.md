Weather app for my tech internship
The weather app can automatically detect user's location or user can also input the city name depending on which the app will display the weather conditions.
The result page include the weather condition,location,temperature,humidity and pressure.
For future development the app aims at showing the future weather details as well as hour wise weather details and suggestions along with UV index and AQI.
